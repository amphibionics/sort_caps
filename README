DESCRIPTION
        $script - A tool that extracts and sorts netlist capacitance from an input parasitics(.SPF) file format.

        Default output filename: "<SPF file>.cap.log"

USAGE
        $script <.spf file> [option]

OPTION
        Required:
        <.spf file>			Input .SPF parasitics file
					Please use -rctype cc during LPE extraction

        Optional:
        -sort [value|node1|node2] 	Will sort according to category
	-above [value]			filters in data above this cap value
	-below [value]			filters in data below this cap value
	-include [string]		filters in data containing this string, accepts white-space separated array
	-exclude [string]		filters out data containing this string, accepts white-space separated array
	-list [list file]		filters in data contained in the list file 
        -aggregate			report total capacitance for each net names
        -nosupply			remove supply nets from capacitance list
        -noaggsupply			remove supply reference nets from total aggregate counts
	-o [file name]			desired output file name
        -h|help                         display help message

EXAMPLES
        1. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -aggregate
                -This generate list of nets together with related nets and values

        2. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -aggregate -nosupply
                -Same as the first example but all supply nets were removed from capacitance list

        3. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -aggregate -noaggsupply
                -Same as the first example but all supply nets were removed from the total aggregate counts

        4. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -aggregate -above 10e-15
                -Same as the first example but all below 10e-15 aggregate values will not be counted in the list

        5. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -sort value
                -This will extract netlist capacitance and will sort capacitance value in decending order

        6. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -sort value -above 0.5e-15
                -This will exclude those with caps value below 0.5e-15

        7. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -sort value -exclude vcc
                -This will exclude those with "vcc" node name

        8. %> sort_caps.pl ebr_RCmax_cc_85C.spf -sort value -exclude "vcc vss" -include "por cib"
                -This will exclude those with "vcc"  and "vss" node names except for those with "por" and "cib" node names
